# ToDoReactApp

Description
Develop a cross-platform Todo App using React Native that is compatible with both iOS and
Android devices. Utilize Expo to create the app and implement the following features:

Features
1. The main screen of the application should display a list of all the created todo tasks.
2. Clicking on a task should navigate the user to a second screen where they can edit or
delete the task.
3. Include an "Add New Task" button on the main screen to enable users to create new
tasks intuitively.
4. Implement data persistence within the app using local storage, ensuring that user data is
retained even when the app is reopened.
5. Apply basic styling to the app, while the design itself is not a priority.
6. Implement scrolling functionality specifically for the Todo List screen, allowing smooth
scrolling within the list only.
